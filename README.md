# MatrixVision

A lightweight forward-pass engine for neural networks using raw matrix operations and image preprocessing.

This project loads a `.png` image, converts it to a 28x28 grayscale matrix, flattens it to a vector, and feeds it into a pre-trained two-layer network using raw matrix multiplication.

## Features

- Image to matrix vector conversion (grayscale, 28x28)
- Import weights for 2-layer neural network
- Matrix-based forward pass (no libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow)
- Based on custom matrix library [MatrixLab](https://github.com/yourname/MatrixLab)
